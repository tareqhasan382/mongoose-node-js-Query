##Question 1: What is the purpose of creating a model with an interface and schema in MongoDB? How does it help in defining the structure of a collection?
==================================
MongoDB automatically validates the data against the defined schema, ensuring that only valid and properly formatted data is stored in the collection.Schemas allow you to specify default values for fields.This helps establish a consistent structure for the data.Readability and organization.Code reusability.Models provide a programming interface to interact with the data in a structured manner, making it easier to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

# ##Question 2: Explain the concept of field filtering in MongoDB. How can you specify which fields to include or exclude in the returned documents?

In MongoDB, field filtering is the process of specifying which fields to include or exclude in the returned documents when querying a collection. It allows you to retrieve only the necessary data and optimize the performance by reducing the amount of data transferred over the network.

To specify which fields to include or exclude can use the projection parameter in the find() method. The projection parameter takes an object where you define the fields to include or exclude.
For example, the following query includes only the "name" and "age" fields:

db.collection.find({}, { name: 1, age: 1 })

# ##Question 3: What are instance methods in MongoDB models? Provide an example of a custom instance method and explain its purpose.?

In MongoDB models, instance methods are custom methods defined on the model instances. These methods can be called on individual documents or instances of the model, allowing you to perform specific operations or computations related to a particular document.

Here's an example of a custom instance method in a MongoDB model using Mongoose:

// Define a schema and model
const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
name: String,
age: Number
});

userSchema.methods.getProfile = function() {
return `Name: ${this.name}, Age: ${this.age}`;
};

const User = mongoose.model('User', userSchema);

// Create a user instance
const user = new User({
name: 'John Doe',
age: 30
});

// Call the custom instance method
console.log(user.getProfile()); // Output: Name: John Doe, Age: 30

Instance methods are useful for encapsulating document-specific functionality, performing computations based on document data, or adding custom behavior to the model instances.

##Question 4: How do you use comparison operators like "$ne," "$gt," "$lt," "$gte," and "$lte" in MongoDB queries? Provide examples to illustrate their usage.

======================================================
In MongoDB queries, comparison operators are used to perform comparisons on the values of fields within documents. Here are examples of how you can use the comparison operators:

#"$ne" (not equal to): Matches documents where the value of a field is not equal to a specified value.

db.collection.find({ field: { $ne: value } })
Example:

db.users.find({ age: { $ne: 25 } })
This query will match all documents in the "users" collection where the "age" field is not equal to 25.

"$gt" (greater than): Matches documents where the value of a field is greater than a specified value.

db.collection.find({ field: { $gt: value } })
Example:

db.users.find({ age: { $gt: 30 } })
This query will match all documents in the "users" collection where the "age" field is greater than 30.

"$lt" (less than): Matches documents where the value of a field is less than a specified value.

db.collection.find({ field: { $lt: value } })
Example:

db.users.find({ age: { $lt: 40 } })
This query will match all documents in the "users" collection where the "age" field is less than 40.

"$gte" (greater than or equal to): Matches documents where the value of a field is greater than or equal to a specified value.

db.collection.find({ field: { $gte: value } })
Example:

db.users.find({ age: { $gte: 25 } })
This query will match all documents in the "users" collection where the "age" field is greater than or equal to 25.

"$lte" (less than or equal to): Matches documents where the value of a field is less than or equal to a specified value.

db.collection.find({ field: { $lte: value } })
Example:

db.users.find({ age: { $lte: 50 } })
This query will match all documents in the "users" collection where the "age" field is less than or equal to 50.

##Question 5: What are MongoDB’s “$in” and “$nin” operators? How can you use them to match values against an array of values or exclude values from a given array?

==================================================
In MongoDB queries, the "$in" and "$nin" operators are used to match values against an array of values or exclude values from a given array.

"$in": Matches documents where the value of a field matches any value in a specified array.
e
db.collection.find({ field: { $in: [value1, value2, ...] } })
Example:

db.users.find({ role: { $in: ['admin', 'moderator'] } })
This query will match all documents in the "users" collection where the "role" field has a value of either "admin" or "moderator".

"$nin": Matches documents where the value of a field does not match any value in a specified array.

db.collection.find({ field: { $nin: [value1, value2, ...] } })
Example:

db.users.find({ role: { $nin: ['admin', 'moderator'] } })
This query will match all documents in the "users" collection where the "role" field does not have a value of either "admin" or "moderator".

The "$in" operator is useful when you want to match multiple possible values against a field, while the "$nin" operator allows you to exclude specific values from the matching criteria.
